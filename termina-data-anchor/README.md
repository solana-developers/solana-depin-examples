# Termina Data Anchor Demo (CLI)

Terminaâ€™s Data Anchor lets teams anchor structured data blobs directly on Solana without custom programs required.
Itâ€™s especially useful for DePIN networks publishing verifiable device data like sensor readings or reward snapshots, in a cost-effective and high-throughput way.

This example uses the CLI to walk through the full flow: upload a JSON reward file, fetch it from chain, and verify its contents locally.
For production use, we recommend the Rust SDK for tighter integration.

A quick look at the data flow of the Data Anchor:

## What this demo shows

This demo simulates a DePIN reward batch upload.

- Two sensors report their data: IPs, COâ‚‚ levels, data points submitted, and reward amounts
- A Merkle root summarizes the batch, and a placeholder zk proof is attached
- The file is uploaded as a blob via the CLI
- The blob is fetched from Solana and decoded
- A script verifies its structure

> Think of this as a simplified version of how large DePIN networks might anchor thousands of device reports at once.

## Folder contents

- `rewards.json` â€“ Mock data file containing a reward batch from 2 devices  
- `upload_blob.sh` â€“ Uploads the JSON to Solana using the Termina CLI  
- `verify_blob.sh` â€“ Fetches and verifies the blob fields

---

## Prerequisites

To run this demo, you just need:

- A terminal (macOS, Linux, or WSL on Windows)
- `jq` and `xxd` installed (used to parse and decode the blob output)

---

## 1. Prepare your data

The file `rewards.json` simulates a real batch upload:

```json
{
  "epoch": 1042,
  "location": "Zug, Switzerland",
  "devices": [
    {
      "device_id": "sensor-001",
      "ip": "192.168.0.101",
      "data_points": 340,
      "co2_ppm": 417,
      "reward": "0.03"
    },
    {
      "device_id": "sensor-002",
      "ip": "192.168.0.102",
      "data_points": 327,
      "co2_ppm": 419,
      "reward": "0.02"
    }
  ],
  "total_reward": "0.05",
  "merkle_root": "abc123xyz456",
  "proof": "mock_zk_proof_here"
}
````

---

## 2. Upload the blob

Run the following to upload the file to Solana via the Data Anchor:

```bash
./upload_blob.sh
```

Youâ€™ll receive one or more blob signatures in response, depending on the file size. These signatures are needed to fetch the blob.

---

## 3. Fetch and decode the blob

Use the CLI and signatures to retrieve the blob:

```bash
nitro-da-cli \
  --program-id "2RWsr92iL39YCLiZu7dZ5hron4oexEMbgWDg35v5U5tH" \
  --namespace "nitro" \
  -o json \
  blob fetch <sig1> <sig2> ... \
  | jq -r '.[].data' | xxd -r -p
```

Replace `<sig1> <sig2> ...` with the signatures you received earlier.

This will return the original JSON content.

---

## 4. Verify the blob contents

To simulate how a verifier or client might validate the blob, run:

```bash
./verify_blob.sh <sig1> <sig2> ...
```

This script checks that the blob includes:

* `device_id`
* `reward`
* `co2_ppm`
* `merkle_root`
* `proof`

> This is an example verification logic. Actual validation requirements may vary based on the domain and use case.
